          "answer": "This is one of the most customer featured questions from all UEDCL communication channels. The responsibility of setting the end user tariff is not of UEDCL nor any other electricity distributor in the country. This function is executed by the Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA) in accordance to the 1999 electricity act and does so every quarter in a year. This means, three tariff schedules are issued by ERA every year and are effectively implemented by UEDCL to its customers. Further details about electricity tariffs can be obtained from www.era.go.ug."
